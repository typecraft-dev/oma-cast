# oma-cast

**A Raycast-esque launcher for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org).**
It learns what you use, searches your apps and every Omarchy action, and looks like it shipped with your theme.

## Why

Omarchy's built-in menu is great at what it does. oma-cast adds what Raycast users miss on Linux:

* **Learns your habits.** Results are ranked with a port of Raycast's root-search algorithm, plus frecency and learned search terms. The things you actually use float to the top, and if you type `ff` and pick Firefox, `ff` keeps meaning Firefox.
* **One search for everything.** Your apps, all ~400 Omarchy menu actions (with breadcrumbs and live ✓ state), web-search fallbacks, and an explicit hand-off to your default coding agent.
* **Your shortcuts.** Give anything an alias, pin favorites, and hide the commands you never touch.
* **Keyboard-first.** A Ctrl+K action panel, Ctrl+1–9 quick picks, search history on ↑, section jumping, and emacs-style navigation.
* **Native to Omarchy.** It runs inside `omarchy-shell` as a plugin, with no Electron and no Node. It opens in about 40 ms and follows your theme live when you run `omarchy theme set`. File search uses a small helper process, enabled by default on new installs (see below).

### Follows your Omarchy theme

There's no theme config. oma-cast binds to Omarchy's own colours, so it changes the moment you switch themes.

## Install

Requires Omarchy 4 (Hyprland 0.56+, `omarchy-shell`) and `socat`, which Omarchy already ships.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/typecraft-dev/oma-cast.git
cd oma-cast
bin/oma-cast install          # link the plugin into omarchy-shell and the CLI into ~/.local/bin
oma-cast setup hyprland       # bind Alt+Space
oma-cast doctor               # check everything is wired up
```

Press **Alt+Space**. Super+Space stays the Omarchy menu. You can change the launcher binding in `~/.config/hypr/oma-cast.lua`.

To remove it: `oma-cast uninstall`.

## File search

New installs enable file search by default. `oma-cast install` builds a small
`oma-cast-files` helper (one `cargo build`) and the launcher indexes file names
under `$HOME` on the first file query. It is a separate process, not linked into
`omarchy-shell`, and it reads no file contents and makes no network calls.

```sh
oma-cast files status          # cached state: root, files, RSS
oma-cast files root ~/Documents   # narrow the index (default: ~)
oma-cast files disable         # stop indexing, keep the data
oma-cast files enable          # turn it back on
oma-cast files build           # rebuild the helper after a pull
oma-cast files retry           # retry after building a missing helper
oma-cast files reset-ranking   # forget file access scores
```

* Existing installs stay off; opt in with `oma-cast files build && oma-cast files enable`.
* Hidden files are not indexed at a non-git root. A git root includes dotfiles,
  except a small secret-name deny list (`.env`, `.ssh`, keys, …).
* Add noisy directories to `~/.ignore` (gitignore syntax), e.g. `data/`.
* Type three or more characters in the launcher to see up to three Files rows;
  `Show All Files` opens the full list. `Ctrl+K` on a file has Open, Open in
  Editor, Reveal, Copy Path and Copy Name.
* A typical 20k-file home costs roughly 20–35 MB with the watcher running and the
  cold scan is tens of milliseconds; a very large home costs more.
  `oma-cast files disable` is the off switch.

## Ask your default agent

Type a question, select **Ask default agent** under the web-search fallbacks,
and press Enter. **Ctrl+Alt+Enter** sends the current root-search text directly.
This opens a new session with your question in Omarchy's configured default
agent and terminal (Foot, Ghostty, Kitty or Alacritty).

The action checks your setup first. Missing agent/terminal setup leaves the
launcher open with your question and an error. Closing the launcher during the
check cancels the pending hand-off. Normal app search and Enter selection keep
working as before; typing alone never submits a question.

Requires an Omarchy version with `omarchy-agent-prompt` and
`omarchy-agent --prompt` (verified against `quattro` revision `3ac4365`). Select
your defaults in Omarchy Settings. Agent authentication, accounts, approval
behaviour, session working directory and terminal selection remain owned by
Omarchy and the agent CLI. oma-cast does not store the question in search history,
read credentials, or make model API calls. Successful preflight checks establish
launch prerequisites, not successful sign-in or a running terminal; those still
need live desktop validation.

## Keyboard

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| `↵` / `Ctrl+↵` / `Ctrl+Shift+↵` | Run the first, second or third action |
| `Ctrl+K` | Open the action panel |
| `Ctrl+Alt+↵` | Ask the default agent using the current root-search text |
| `Ctrl+1`…`9` | Pick a result |
| `↑` on an empty search | Search history |
| `Ctrl+↑` / `Ctrl+↓` | Jump between sections |
| `Ctrl+N` / `Ctrl+P` | Next / previous |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F` | Add to favorites (`Ctrl+Alt+↑↓` to reorder) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Copy |
| `Alt+Shift+D` | Disable a command |
| `Esc` / `Shift+Esc` | Back / back to root |
| `Ctrl +` / `Ctrl −` / `Ctrl 0` | Zoom |

## CLI

```sh
oma-cast toggle | show | hide
oma-cast run <commandId>         # e.g. app:com.mitchellh.ghostty, omarchy:style.theme
oma-cast call <method> [json]    # call any backend method
oma-cast files status            # file-search state (see above)
oma-cast doctor
```

## Roadmap

oma-cast is early. Search, ranking and the Omarchy integration are done. Coming next:

- [ ] Settings window
- [ ] File search previews and content search
- [ ] Script Commands
- [ ] Clipboard history, snippets, quicklinks, calculator
- [ ] Running Raycast extensions built from the open-source [`raycast/extensions`](https://github.com/raycast/extensions) repo
- [ ] Window management
- [ ] Importing your `.rayconfig` from macOS

The full plan is in [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md); the file-search design is in [`docs/file-search.md`](docs/file-search.md).

## Development

```sh
node --test tests/*.test.js # unit tests, no npm install needed
tests/smoke.sh            # live checks against the running shell
oma-cast dev          # reload on every save
cargo test --manifest-path helper/Cargo.toml   # file-search helper tests
oma-cast files build  # rebuild the helper after editing helper/
```

Quickshell caches QML for the life of the process, so run `oma-cast reload` after editing anything under `plugin/`. See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the layout and conventions.

## Notes

oma-cast is an independent, clean-room project. It isn't affiliated with or endorsed by Raycast, and it contains no Raycast code or assets. It never contacts Raycast's servers and has no telemetry. Its agent action explicitly hands your question to Omarchy's existing coding-agent launcher; it provides no embedded AI runtime.
