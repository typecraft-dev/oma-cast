# oma-cast

**A Raycast-style launcher for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org).**
It learns what you use, searches your apps and every Omarchy action, and looks like it shipped with your theme.

## Why

Omarchy's built-in menu is great at what it does. oma-cast adds what Raycast users miss on Linux:

* **Learns your habits.** Results are ranked with a port of Raycast's root-search algorithm, plus frecency and learned search terms. The things you actually use float to the top, and if you type `ff` and pick Firefox, `ff` keeps meaning Firefox.
* **One search for everything.** Your apps, all ~400 Omarchy menu actions (with breadcrumbs and live ✓ state), and web-search fallbacks, all in one ranked list.
* **Your shortcuts.** Give anything an alias, pin favorites, and hide the commands you never touch.
* **Keyboard-first.** A Ctrl+K action panel, Ctrl+1–9 quick picks, search history on ↑, section jumping, and emacs-style navigation.
* **Native to Omarchy.** It runs inside `omarchy-shell` as a plugin, with no Electron, no Node and no extra daemons. It opens in about 40 ms and follows your theme live when you run `omarchy theme set`.

### Follows your Omarchy theme

There's no theme config. oma-cast binds to Omarchy's own colours, so it changes the moment you switch themes.

## Install

Requires Omarchy 4 (Hyprland 0.56+, `omarchy-shell`) and `socat`, which Omarchy already ships.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/typecraft-dev/oma-cast.git
cd oma-cast
bin/oma-cast install          # link the plugin into omarchy-shell and the CLI into ~/.local/bin
oma-cast setup hyprland       # bind Alt+Space
oma-cast doctor               # check everything is wired up
```

Press **Alt+Space**. Super+Space stays the Omarchy menu. If you'd rather have oma-cast there, the swap is in `~/.config/hypr/oma-cast.lua`, commented out.

To remove it: `oma-cast uninstall`.

## Keyboard

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| `↵` / `Ctrl+↵` / `Ctrl+Shift+↵` | Run the first, second or third action |
| `Ctrl+K` | Open the action panel |
| `Ctrl+1`…`9` | Pick a result |
| `↑` on an empty search | Search history |
| `Ctrl+↑` / `Ctrl+↓` | Jump between sections |
| `Ctrl+N` / `Ctrl+P` | Next / previous |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F` | Add to favorites (`Ctrl+Alt+↑↓` to reorder) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Copy |
| `Alt+Shift+D` | Disable a command |
| `Esc` / `Shift+Esc` | Back / back to root |
| `Ctrl +` / `Ctrl −` / `Ctrl 0` | Zoom |

## CLI

```sh
oma-cast toggle | show | hide
oma-cast run <commandId>         # e.g. app:com.mitchellh.ghostty, omarchy:style.theme
oma-cast call <method> [json]    # call any backend method
oma-cast doctor
```

## Roadmap

oma-cast is early. Search, ranking and the Omarchy integration are done. Coming next:

- [ ] Settings window
- [ ] Script Commands
- [ ] Clipboard history, snippets, quicklinks, calculator
- [ ] Running Raycast extensions built from the open-source [`raycast/extensions`](https://github.com/raycast/extensions) repo
- [ ] Window management
- [ ] Importing your `.rayconfig` from macOS

The full plan is in [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md).

## Development

```sh
node --test tests/*.test.js   # unit tests, no npm install needed
tests/smoke.sh            # live checks against the running shell
oma-cast dev          # reload on every save
```

Quickshell caches QML for the life of the process, so run `oma-cast reload` after editing anything under `plugin/`. See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the layout and conventions.

## Notes

oma-cast is an independent, clean-room project. It isn't affiliated with or endorsed by Raycast, and it contains no Raycast code or assets. It never contacts Raycast's servers, has no telemetry and no AI features.
